<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Lamps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFL)</li><li>Light Emitting Diodes (LED)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solar lamps market primarily features two types: Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFL) and Light Emitting Diodes (LED). CFLs are energy-efficient, producing light by gas excitation, making them a cost-effective choice for many users. However, they are bulkier and take longer to warm up. LEDs, on the other hand, are more energy-efficient, durable, and provide instant illumination. They have a longer lifespan and are increasingly favored for solar applications due to their lower energy consumption and versatility in design.</p></p>
